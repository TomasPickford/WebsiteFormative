Interest of content - Outstanding

The two articles cover relevant and relatable topics than builds on what is common knowledge and introduces new ideas and case studies. The only negative is that both pages cover similar applications of computing (health), which doesn't exemplify the wide range of effects computing has on society.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Exemplary

The site is bright and colourful yet has a consistent theme than is present on all three pages. The structure is easy to follow with many intuitive ways to get to the same page, or even a different section on the same page. Generic images are successfully used to break up paragraphs of text, making pages more inviting to read. The second image on the tech-hospital page is inserted mid-sentence so feels out of place and is distruptive to the flow of the paragraph.

Quality of written presentation - Excellent

A natural and engaging tone is used in both articles. There are a few minor grammatical mistakes.

Validity of HTML - Perfect


Evidence of collaboration - Outstanding

Aaron contibuted many more lines than Jeffrey however both wrote their own article independently. A few changes were made last minute but most content was added at the start of the week.
